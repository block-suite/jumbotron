# Jumbotron

Displaying multiple videos use to be hard, then Jumbotron was created.

Every block is a solution to a problem. I was working on a personal project, a fansite for the Microsoft Zune, and was frustrated trying to populate a page with a bunch of videos. Sure it's easier with blocks then it use to be but it is still a bit clunky. I had the idea to create a better way. Thus, Jumbotron was born. Heavily inspired by [Rivyt](https://rivyt.com/) because they are awesome, Jumbotron turns your mess of videos into a playlist style that people can actually use. We also support the displaying of descriptions as some videos really need context to be understood.
